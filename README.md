## Motivation
As you may know there's plenty of published virtualization tools: VirtualBox,
VMWare, QEMU ... just to name a few. Unfortunately in my vastly ignorance and 
as far as I know, all of them need chipset virtualization enabled, which is
something that I can't currently access.

And here I am, writing how MachineGun is born as a need to build a flexible 
development and sand-boxing environment in a barely metal machine without 
virtualization technologies enabled.
